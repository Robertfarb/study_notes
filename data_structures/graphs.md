## Graphs
* Graphs have vertices (dots) and Edges (lines)
* Edges can have direction and weight
* Directed Graph: 
  * Every single edge must be directed
* Graph edges can also have weight
* Facebook is an example of a graph
  * What are the edges going to be and the vertices going to be
  * Vertices: Facebook users
  * Edges: Friendship relationship
    * Connect user a to user b if and only if a & b are friends
    * Edges here will be unweighted and undirecitonal
* |V| = num of vertices on a graph
* |E| = num of edges on a graph
* density of a graph
  * |E| / (|V| * (|V| - 1))

### Twitter Graph
* Vertices: one for each user
* Edges: A -> B if a is following B

## The DOM is an example of a graph
* vertices: DOM Elements
* Edges: parents, chidlren
