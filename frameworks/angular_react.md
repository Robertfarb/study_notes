# Angular.Js vs. React.js
### Angular is a MVVM Framework founded in 2009
  * There is two way data binding in Angular.js
  * MVVM allows developers to work separately on the same app section using the same set of data
  * Angular is an entire framework whereas react only deals with Views
  * bi-directional data-binding

### `React.js` is a JS framework great for building huge web applications where data is changeable on a regular basis
  * one way data binding (children cannot affect parent elements)
  * highly scalable
  * Virtual dom with a fast diffing algorithm that determines the only elements that must be updated, and only those are updated
  * Very light weight
  * uni-directional data binding
