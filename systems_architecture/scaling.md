# Scaling

## Horizontal v. Vertical Scaling
  * `Horizontal Scaling`: Scale by adding more machines into pool of resources
  * `Vertical Scaling`: Scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine
  * Good examples of horizontal scaling in terms of Dbs:
    * Cassandra, MongoDB, Google Cloud Spanner
