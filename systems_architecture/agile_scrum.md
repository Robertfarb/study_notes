# Agile & Scrum Methodology
* Scrum is a popular agile software development framework
* What is Scrum?
  * Scrum is a framework for developing complex products and systems. It is grounded in empirical process and control theory.
  * Scrum employs an iterative and incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk
  * Do something -> check adapt -> optimize -> check adapt...
  * Iterative Approach: Build the skeleton of the entire product, then continue to iterate on that original product, and continue to iteratively improve until there is a final perfect product
* Scrum Overview
  * Vision -> Product Backlog (Series of features, that continuously gets added to) -> Sprint Backlog (detailed requirements, broken down into activity level) -> Product Increment (working product) -> continue building the prodct piece by piece
* Various Scrum roles
  * Three roles:
    * Product Owner
      * Get's input from end users, customer, team and stake holders and comes up with the Product backlog
      * `Product backlog`: single master list of features
        * Constantly being revised by the product owner
    * Scrum Master
    * Scrum team
      * Cross functional team made up of designers, engineers, QA, and devops
      * Self managed, self-organized
      * Team creates the sprint backlog, which is a detailed version of the features, and the prioritization of the activity tasks
      * Before each sprint, the team commits to what they will deliver by the end of the sprint
      * The team breaks down this commitment into tasks, and delegates these tasks to each team-member
* `Sprint`: Fixed period of time the team commits to work on the course of development product. 
  * The sprint length is set (4 weeks for example).
  * Fixed set of time the team commits to develop the product.
  * We don't want to change the time of the originally commited sprint
  * Fixed sprints at a sustainable pace
  * There are daily standup / scrum meetings that take about 15 minutes where you update the team on your daily completions, what you have to do for the day, and any shortcomings, or issues that you're having
*
