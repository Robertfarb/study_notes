## Service Worker Overview
* A service worker is a JS script that the browser runs in the background, separate from a webpage. It opens the door to features that don't need a webpage or user interaction.
* Features allowed include push notifications and background sync. 
* The core feature of a service worker is the ability to intercept and handle network requests, including programatically managing a cache of responses.
* Service workers allow us to support offline experiences, giving developers complete control over the experience.
