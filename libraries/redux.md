## What is Redux?
  * Redux is a JavaScript library that follows Flux Architecture.
  * Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
  * Redux is a unidirectional way of updating views and handling user actions.
  * Redux is framework agnostic

## Unidirectional Data Flow
  * The application has a central root / state (The store in Redux)
  * A state change triggers view updates
  * Only special functions can change the state
  * A user interaction triggers these special state changing functions
  Only one change takes place at a  time.
